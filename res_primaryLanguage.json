      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Allison Eglow. My relationship with yoga began in 2016 but it wasnâ€™t firmly planted until 2020 when I got a lower back injury. The practice of syncing breath with movement helped quiet my mind and soothe my body. I completed a 200-hour teacher training at Indigo Yoga in 2022 and I want to use yoga to create positive change and reach as many humans as possible. I enjoy teaching a Vinyasa flow that incorporates strength with breath work. I aim to share a simple and playful approach while encouraging students to explore their own movement and breath. I believes everyone, of all shapes and sizes, can practice yoga and am deeply committed to fostering an inclusive space for all.",
